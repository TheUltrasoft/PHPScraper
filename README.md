# PHPScraper
PHPScraper is a **jQuery** like object oriented php scraper and web automation library.

If you are familiar with jQuery syntax, it will be a breeze for you to request a page, click on a link, process selected elements together and so on. If you have questions or problems with installation or usage [create an Issue](https://bitbucket.org/theultrasoft/phpscraper/issues).

## Installation:
If you have composer installed run command:
    composer require curl/curl
    
Or if you prefer to add it manually using `composer.json` add this:
    "phpscraper/phpscraper": "*"
    
This will install the latest version (currently: v0.1.1-beta) of PHPScraper into your project.

## Usage examples:
```php
    $engine = new \PHPScraper\Engine();
    $engine->get('https://www.example.com/', NULL, function( $headers, $body ) {
        $body->find('a.some-link')->click(function ($headers, $body) {
            echo $body;
            // Do whatever you want to do
        });
    });
```
